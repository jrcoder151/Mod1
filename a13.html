                <h2>About cats</h2>
                <p>
                    Cats are fascinating and highly adaptable creatures that have been domesticated for thousands of years. Known for their agility, they possess a flexible skeletal structure and powerful muscles that allow them to jump up to six times their body length in a single leap. Cats communicate through a combination of vocalizations, such as meows and purrs, as well as body language and facial expressions. They have excellent night vision, thanks to a high concentration of rod cells in their retinas, making them exceptional hunters, especially in low light. A cat's whiskers are highly sensitive and help them navigate their environment by detecting changes in air currents. These independent yet affectionate animals are cherished as pets worldwide and are estimated to be owned by over 400 million households globally.

                    Cats are small, carnivorous mammals belonging to the Felidae family, domesticated for thousands of years. They have a strong hunting instinct and are known for their agility, sharp claws, and retractable paws. Cats communicate using a range of vocalizations, including purring, meowing, and hissing, as well as through body language. They have excellent night vision, allowing them to see in low-light conditions, and a keen sense of hearing that detects ultrasonic sounds. With an independent and playful nature, cats are one of the most popular pets worldwide.
